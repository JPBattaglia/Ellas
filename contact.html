                    <h5>Established in 1969, Ella's Pizza is often referred to as a San Francisco institution, as it is the oldest standing, 24-hour Pizza Shop in Union Square.<br><br></h5>

                    <h5>Ella's Pizza was founded in 1969 by Ella and Nino Battaglia, both immigrants of Portugal and Italy. Having been left orphaned after WWII, Nino and his siblings dreamed of moving to America and leaving their bad memories behind. On their long and difficult journey, they worked in restaurants in Italy and eventually escaped the cold to Sicily, where Nino worked his way to the ownership of Nino's Pizza Shop, in the Cefalu town. After learning that his father once lived in New York City in the late 1800's (while owning, "Nino Bar", a bar in Jack London Square the siblings discovered that they were eligible for American citizenship. Once established, they brought their spouses and children to America.<br><br>
                    After living through a winter in New York and obsessed with the notion of living where his father once lived, Nino moved his family to San Francisco where he worked in multiple restaurants until landing at the corner of Clay and Kearny. The original Ella's Pizza (named after a busy Pizza Shop in Bayshore, Long Island, NY, where Ella once worked) was located on Powell & Sutter. Prior to that, Nino & Ella owned Piero's on sixth and market and ran the banquet facility at the Canterbury Hotel.<br><br>
                    Nino & Ella fed and employed many immigrants who came to San Francisco seeking job opportunities- many of which moved on to successes of their own. They also supported many Italian and Poruguese politicians who's gathering spot was Ell's. Today, Ella's is frequented by tourists, conventioneers and locals by day and the Bay Area party seen by night, as it is located in the heart of San Francisco's nightlife.<br><br>
                    Since 2008, Ella's has been owned and operated by Ella's son, Piero and daughter in law, Ella. At the age of 2, Ella's was Piero's playground as his parents spent their waking hours there. As the years progressed, Piero worked as a bus boy & dishwasher being fired multiple times by his father. Ella began working at Ella's as a teenager. Prior to 2008, the couple had been back and forth through the years starting other businesses of their own- both in and out of the restaurant industry. In 2005, partnered with other family members, Piero and Ella opened the Piero Pies in Daly City. In 2007, the couple opened Feeder Grill in Petaluma and in 2016, the couple opened The Blue Chicken Restaurant and Bar in San Jose.<br><br>
                    Piero & Ella have modified Ella's Pizza menu through the years by continuously increasing food quality to compete with the newest trends, while still maintaining a well-oiled machine. If you haven't done so yet, you should take a seat at the counter and watch the show.<br><br>
                    Ella's is often referred to as a San Francisco institution, as it is the oldest standing, 24-hour Wood Fired Oven pizza maker in Union Square. Although completely gutted in 2010, the brick oven maintains its same nostalgic feel. Most importantly, Nino can still be found sitting at the counter (as an iconic figure) greeting guests from all around the world who return again & again to reminisce a moment in time. Everyone has walked through the doors- young & old, rich & poor, famous & crazy...Ella's has seen it all! The best stories are those meetings of love and marriage.<br><br>
                    The family is not the only familiar face you will find at Ella's Pizza, as most of the staff has been working for the family for years- a fact that speaks volumes about the establishment. Please come visit us for a taste of San Francisco's history.</h5>
